# prml_solutions

This is a repository that contains my "long-form" solutions for Christopher Bishop's "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning" ([link](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2006/01/Bishop-Pattern-Recognition-and-Machine-Learning-2006.pdf)). I try and be explicit for every nontrivial step in each exercise (which are commonly some sort of "proof"). I will continuously update the repository after chunks of exercises have been completed. Please raise an issue if you find any errors! 


### Update | *08/19/2023*

First chunk of exercise solutions uploaded. I think it's about the first ~20 exercises from Chapter 1 (minus two that are of the hardest difficulty...which are denoted by the `***` symbol in the book).
